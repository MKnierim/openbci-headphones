If we want our science and technology to grow faster, we need to get more people on it, right?

So, for those who also believe that Earables should be developed by more of us, this repository is for you!
It contains the description and materials for turning the OpenBCI EXG biosignal acquisition system into 
a pair of functional headphones that can also record EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG signals.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please send a message to contact@expeeeriments.io


## Version

This is version 1.1 of these open-source EEG headphones. The major changes to V1.0 are:

- **C5 & C6 Electrode Positions** (in addition to previous electrodes)
- **Metal Spring Electrodes** (more robust and better suspension than the 3d-printed springs)
- **Re-designed Covers** (with much easier access to amplifier board and battery)
- **Solder-Free Assembly** (reduced the number of tools required for the assembly)
- **Numerous Small Improvements** (sturdier electrodes with a grip, wider headband, modular headband, ...)

# Assembly

For a summary of the materials and assembly steps head on over to the <a href="docs/Assembly.md">Assembly Instructions</a> page. The instructions show how to assemble the headphones version V1.1. The documentation for V1.0 is available in the <a href="https://github.com/MKnierim/openbci-headphones/releases/tag/v1.0">V1.0 release</a>.


# Use

After assembly, the headphones can be used just like any other OpenBCI hardware. We have summarised the <a href="docs/Recordings.md">use instructions here</a>.
